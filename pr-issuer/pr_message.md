Hello there! I have some formatting suggestions you might find useful.

I'm RustyRobot and my mission is to empower awesome software authors to keep the code clean and formatted. 
Common formatting style is crucial for attracting contributors from all over the world.

If you have a rustfmt.toml in you repo, it already have been loaded into my circuits and I processed your code according to the config.

##### Feedback

I'm only learning how to do my job best and I'd appreciate if you could leave your feedback here:
